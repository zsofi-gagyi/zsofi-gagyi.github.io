# Gradient knitting pattern generator

There are many ways for knitting gradients, but if one wants to use two colors in alternating rows, this tool can generate a pattern for that. Based on my quarantine knitting project (the gradient in the picture was calculated using a very low-resolution circle in Paint).

This project uses the https://p5js.org/ library.
